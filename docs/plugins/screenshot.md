# Screenshot

Screenshot brings the local Snap capture and editing implementation into one native MacTools plugin. Install the package through the plugin flow, then open **Screenshot** from its feature panel, unified search, or an optional shortcut. It has no separate menu-bar app, background capture service, or third-party runtime dependency.

Adapted from the [Snap screenshot implementation](https://github.com/idev19/Snap) and integrated with MacToolsPluginKit.

## Capture and edit

- **Capture Screenshot** opens a visible selection interface across connected displays. Only the display under the pointer previews a target window and shows the mode bar, including when moving between displays; stale hover highlights are cleared immediately. Other displays remain evenly dimmed unless they contain a selection; moving the pointer does not discard that selection. Window targeting includes visible menu bar popovers, menus, floating panels, and standard app windows while excluding system overlays; translucent menu materials keep their captured appearance in preview and export. Drag to select a region or click a highlighted target. Add rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, freehand marks, text, numbered tags, mosaic, blur, or a spotlight before copying, saving, or pinning the image.
- **Spotlight** (H) keeps a dragged window at full brightness and clarity inside a rounded rectangle and covers the rest of the selection with a translucent dark mask, so one chat message or control stands out while its surroundings remain readable as context. Several windows share one mask, so overlapping windows stay clear. Marks drawn before the spotlight are dimmed together with the background; QR masks stay opaque on top. The preview and the exported PNG use the same compositing.
- **Capture visibility** uses a clear dimmed backdrop, the system accent color for window and selection outlines, and balanced hover spacing. Start-confirmation bars and active scrolling/recording controls share the same glass capsule, regular-size native buttons, and padding.
- **Mode bar** uses slightly larger controls, sits 4 points below the screen's top edge, and moves horizontally using its left-hand grip. Movement stays within screen edges and avoids the camera housing; each display retains its dragged position during the current capture.
- **Magnifier** shows the pointer coordinates and current RGB or HEX color in separate left-aligned rows. Press Tab to switch formats; Command-C copies the displayed value and closes capture.
- **Quick Capture** uses the same selection interface and immediately copies the selected image after selection.
- **Text and QR recognition** processes the frozen selection locally. Recognized content can be edited and copied. Closing the panel, changing the selection or mode, or ending capture prevents an earlier recognition request from publishing its result. The QR **Mask** action uses an opaque black fill in preview and export. Mosaic and blur remain visual effects and should not be used to reliably redact sensitive content.
- **Recognition actions** use the same native capsule button style and sizing as scrolling and recording confirmation actions. The footer can show Close, Mask, Open Link, and Done according to the recognized content.
- **Pinned images** stay in a movable window for reference. Use Command-S to save, and Escape or a double-click to close.
- **Scrolling screenshots** continuously capture the selected region while you scroll it downward yourself. Select the scrolling content rather than fixed headers or footers. Finish to copy and pin the assembled image, or cancel to discard it. Ambiguous or unmatched content is not appended; the controls explain how to recover. Matching and composition run on a serial background worker, with only the newest pending frame retained. Output is limited to 128 MiB of RGBA pixels and 32,768 rows, with an additional working-pixel budget that can lower this limit for large viewports. Reaching a limit stops capture with guidance to use smaller sections.
- **Region recording** is available on macOS 15 or later. Choose the recording mode and a region, then start and stop using the visible controls. It saves a MOV file without microphone or system audio, checking hardware codec support before starting the native recording output. A click-through accent-colored outline marks the selected region while capture is active and is excluded from the video. It stays within the target display at screen edges and hides when native capture stops, even while the file is still finalizing. The timer starts when recording actually starts. Completion requires both native capture termination and recording-file finalization; slow finalization keeps showing progress instead of reporting a false failure. Unsupported hardware encoding dimensions produce guidance to select a smaller region.
- **Auto Zoom** is off by default and can be switched on from the recording confirmation bar or the plugin settings. While recording, clicks inside the region are noted with their time; clicks on MacTools' own controls and outside the region are ignored. After the file is finalized, the saved recording is re-encoded once: the view zooms smoothly to 2× toward each click slightly before it happens, follows nearby clicks, holds briefly, and eases back to the full frame without overshoot. Recordings without clicks are left untouched. The status panel shows processing progress; invoking the capture action during processing skips the pass and keeps the unprocessed recording, and a processing failure keeps the original file and says so.

Escape closes the active selection interface. Screenshot and Quick Capture global shortcuts are unassigned by default and are configured above the output section in the plugin's settings. While scrolling capture or recording is active, the capture action finishes that session instead of opening another selection interface.

## Permissions and compatibility

The plugin supports macOS 14 or later on Apple silicon and Intel. Region recording additionally requires macOS 15 or later; screenshot editing, recognition, pinning, and scrolling capture remain available on macOS 14.

MacTools owns the Screen Recording permission card (`screen-recording`, kind `screenRecording`). Grant permission from that card when you choose to capture, and follow any macOS instruction to relaunch MacTools. The plugin does not request Accessibility, microphone, or system-audio recording access. Permission denial or revocation must leave a clear recovery path in the host.

## Privacy and retention

Screen images, visible window geometry, recognized text, and codes may contain sensitive information. Capture starts only through an explicit foreground action with a visible selection interface. The two canonical actions do not support external Run Links, automatic rules, or App Intents. The plugin does not capture on startup or run unattended screenshot jobs.

Capture, recognition, editing, and image assembly use Apple frameworks locally. The plugin has no upload, network service, or telemetry. Choosing to open a recognized link explicitly hands that URL to the user's browser; screenshots and recognized text are not sent to a service by the plugin.

Screenshots are copied to the system clipboard unless you choose a save operation. Saved images use PNG; recordings use MOV. The default destination is `~/Desktop/screenshot`; the folder is created on the first save, and the plugin's settings can select another folder. The selected folder is stored in plugin-scoped preferences. Exported files remain until you manage or delete them yourself; clipboard content remains subject to macOS and other clipboard applications.

Ending a selection hides its reusable capture surfaces, clears image references and annotation contents, and prevents pending work from publishing stale results. Idle surfaces do not acquire or retain desktop snapshots. Disabling the plugin destroys these surfaces and closes pinned images and auxiliary windows. Unsaved edits are discarded. If recording has already created a file, interruption or an error can leave an incomplete MOV file in the selected output folder; inspect or remove it yourself.

The package declares `uninstallDataPolicy: removePrivateData`. The host removes the plugin's private preferences, support, cache, and temporary data on uninstall. Cleanup does not delete screenshots or recordings exported to a user-selected folder, and it does not clear the system clipboard or revoke MacTools' shared Screen Recording permission.

## Development and validation

### Capture presentation architecture

The plugin prepares one hidden nonactivating `NSPanel` per display when activated. This prepares native controls, not a screenshot or recording stream. Each explicit invocation acquires fresh opaque display images before ordering any panel. macOS 26 uses the public rectangle-based `SCScreenshotManager` API without shareable-content discovery; earlier systems use display filters. Requests run with at most three concurrent display jobs per session. Failures propagate to the user; acquisition does not fall back to obsolete CoreGraphics capture APIs. Cancellation rejects late results; it does not claim to cancel a committed operating-system screenshot request. Frame callbacks have a two-second failure deadline, not an artificial presentation delay.

Before each presentation, the pool checks each cached panel's public `isOnActiveSpace` property, including hidden panels. If AppKit reports an inactive Space, only that display's panel is closed and recreated; unaffected panels retain their controls. Panels also use `canJoinAllApplications` to join other apps' full-screen Spaces without participating in Stage Manager's window layout. Both APIs are available throughout the macOS 14+ support range. This check runs after image acquisition and adds no idle polling or Space-change observers.

On macOS 26 and later, screenshot configuration explicitly sets `ignoreShadows = false` to preserve system-drawn window framing, including glass edge highlights and shadows within the captured region. Relying on the default can remove these effects from the source image before either preview or export. This is separate from optional annotation shadows and does not reconstruct window decorations.

The original `CGImage` is assigned directly to a dedicated `CALayer`, with the source color space assigned to its window. Separate shape layers draw dimming and selection outlines, and an explicit shadow path keeps shadow composition independent of annotation drawing. The size badge and magnifier use small retained AppKit views; the magnifier reuses its source image, localized hints, and a one-pixel sRGB sampling context. The annotation view remains hidden during initial selection and is invalidated explicitly when marks or editing handles change. AppKit coalesces redraws; mouse release always commits the final position. Pointer movement does not redraw the full frozen image or create a full-screen bitmap sampler. The preview, recognition input, and PNG export all use the same frozen source. There is no live-window replacement, popover reconstruction, alpha workaround, startup capture, or continuous idle stream. Display-topology changes cancel selection and rebuild the pool through the host's `DisplayTopologyRefreshing` hook.

Pointer ownership and window targeting use AppKit mouse-rectangle semantics, including the top edge and excluding the bottom edge in unflipped coordinates. This gives vertically adjacent displays one owner at their shared edge without coordinate offsets. Capture panels and their content views disable native window movement; the mode-bar grip still moves only its own view horizontally. Mouse gestures use native AppKit dispatch. No global input hook, polling timer, or forced synchronous display is added to the drag path. Synthetic AppKit input tests verify selection geometry, not physical input delivery at the display edge.

The native window has an opaque background as well as `isOpaque = true`. An opaque frozen-image layer alone is insufficient: on the affected multi-display system, a clear native background routed exact-top-edge presses to the menu bar instead of the capture panel. A reversible comparison in the actual host reproduced failure with a clear background, success with an opaque background, failure after restoring clear, and success after restoring opaque, without changing application activation or window geometry. The background is behind the unchanged frozen image and does not alter export pixels or dimming. Regression coverage checks that this backing remains opaque across ordinary and quick capture reuse; WindowServer delivery still requires an integration check on the target system.

Layout and drawing are prepared while hidden, implicit layer actions and window ordering animations are disabled, and all panels are submitted in one main-actor turn. A Core Animation transaction does not guarantee synchronized physical scanout on separate displays. Use Instruments or a high-frame-rate recording to validate real shortcut-to-visible latency, cold and warm invocation, mixed refresh rates, Space changes, and menu-bar material fidelity before making latency guarantees.

Selection panels set their final `.screenSaver` level after configuring panel flags: setting `isFloatingPanel` resets the level to `.floating`. This keeps the capture surface above ordinary menus and popovers for native mouse delivery without activating the underlying application. Use the public level constant, not its numeric value or repeated ordering calls.

### Continuous capture architecture

Recording and scrolling share geometry, control preparation, native stream ownership, and control presentation, but keep their domain state separate:

| Responsibility | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Pixel-aligned selection and target-display validation | `CaptureRegion` |
| Hidden control realization, full content discovery, exact window exclusion | `CaptureSessionPreparation` and `CaptureControls` |
| Serialized native start/stop and acknowledged termination | `CaptureStreamSession` |
| Recording output, elapsed time, file/capture completion coordination | `Recorder` and `RecordingLifecycle` |
| Click timeline, zoom motion, and the post-recording re-encode | `RecordingClickTracker`, `AutoZoomPlan`, and `AutoZoomComposer` |
| Complete-frame delivery, bounded processing, stitching | `ScrollSession`, `ScrollFrameSource`, `ScrollCapture`, and `ScrollStitchingWorker` |
| Shared confirmation/status appearance and screen-clamped placement | `CaptureActionBar` and `CaptureStatusPanel` |
| Serialized background PNG/TIFF encoding and background file writes | `ScreenshotImageEncoder` |

Control windows are materialized while hidden, then resolved through `SCShareableContent` with `onScreenWindowsOnly: false`. A just-created window can exist without appearing in an on-screen-only snapshot. Exclusion uses only this session's exact window IDs, not every window owned by MacTools. Controls are ordered only after constructing the filter and configuring the output; their positions stay inside the selected display even for full-screen selections. Missing control IDs fail closed, with ID/count-only diagnostics. There is no visibility retry loop, off-screen staging window, delayed show, or window-sharing workaround.

The coordinator owns a session before asynchronous preparation starts. Cancellation during startup prevents later UI presentation; cancellation after native start requests a real stop and keeps ownership until the system acknowledges termination. A ten-second native-operation warning does not claim that capture stopped. A returned stop error permits an explicit retry; a still-pending native call is not overlapped by another stop. Recording additionally waits for the output delegate's final callback, including cancellation, and never publishes a file merely because `stopCapture` returned. Display changes stop continuous capture and prevent changed-geometry frames from entering the stitcher.

Auto Zoom never touches the live stream. A global mouse-down monitor, which excludes this process, records click times against the moment the recording output reports it started, mapped to a top-left fraction of the region. When the lifecycle settles with a file and at least one click, `AutoZoomComposer` reads the MOV with `AVAssetReader`, steps a critically damped motion toward the plan's targets on a fixed 30 fps cadence, and appends a frame only when the source frame or the zoom state changed, so static content stays compact while zoom motion stays smooth even though ScreenCaptureKit recordings have sparse samples. Frames at identity are passed through unchanged; zoomed frames are cropped and scaled with Core Image using no color management and propagated buffer attachments, so both kinds encode alike. The result is written beside the recording as a hidden temporary file with the same codec and replaces the original only after `AVAssetWriter` completes; cancellation or any failure removes the temporary file and keeps the original. Display changes do not interrupt processing.

Scrolling uses a 10 fps ScreenCaptureKit stream with queue depth three, accepts only complete frames, materializes independent pixels, and feeds an `AsyncStream` with one newest-frame slot. Matching uses bounded row samples followed by full-resolution verification and ambiguity rejection; rejected frames do not replace the last accepted reference. New strips own only their copied pixels. Before allocating, the stitcher reserves six viewport buffers and three output-sized buffers within a 384 MiB working-pixel budget, in addition to the output limits. This is an allocation estimate, not a bound on framework allocations or total process RSS. PNG/TIFF encoding is serialized off the main actor; clipboard conversion cannot overwrite a newer clipboard revision.

A September 16, 2026 native smoke probe on the local Apple silicon system resolved both hidden control windows, captured only a synthetic opaque window, produced and decoded a 512 × 384 silent MOV, delivered complete scrolling frames, and acknowledged both stream stop and file completion when cancelled immediately after starting. No desktop content was captured or saved by that probe. The 87 focused Screenshot tests and 16 minimum-host checks passed; all 268 repository script checks passed after explicitly matching `SDKROOT` to the selected Xcode toolchain, without changing global configuration. These checks do not replace manual verification on macOS 14/15, Intel, or mixed-scale display arrangements.

### Validation commands

Plugin targets are discovered from `Plugins/Screenshot/plugin.json`. The plugin's `project.yml` only adds ScreenCaptureKit, Vision, CoreImage, UniformTypeIdentifiers, QuartzCore, and VideoToolbox linker flags. Do not modify root project targets or generated plugin configuration to register it.

After preparing local signing settings, generate the project and build the plugin:

```sh
make generate
make build-plugin PLUGIN=Screenshot
```

Run script checks for source-manifest projection, generated project configuration, and PluginKit minimum-host compatibility:

```sh
make script-tests
```

Run the adjacent Screenshot test classes and `PluginRuntimeActionSnapshotTests` through the generated host test target, limiting execution with `-only-testing:MacToolsTests/<TestClassName>`. Use injected images, permission checks, and asynchronous capture/recognition closures in tests; tests must not capture the real desktop or delete user files.

Before release, check region and window selection on a single display and mixed-scale multiple displays; annotations, spotlight windows, and PNG output; auto zoom recordings with clicks, without clicks, and cancelled during processing; OCR and QR success, failure, and cancellation; pin closure; repeated scrolling start/finish/cancel; Screen Recording denial and revocation; plugin deactivation during pending work; and successful and failed recording finalization on macOS 15 or later. Confirm macOS 14 hides or explains the unavailable recording mode, optional shortcuts remain unassigned, and uninstall preserves exported files. Verify translated labels and errors in English and Simplified Chinese.
